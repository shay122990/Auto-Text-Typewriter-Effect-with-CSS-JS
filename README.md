# Auto Text Effect

## About The Project

- This is a simple landing page with the auto text/typewriter effect.
- It looks great on landing/hero pages but can also be added to paragraphs.
- You can achieve this effect with HTML & CSS alone and I've linked a page for that. However in this example we use JS for to learn about DOM manipulation and speed control.
- For learning purposes, a speed controller is included at the bottom.
- All references are linked below in the _Built with_ section.

## Installation

This is a working code example.
You can copy the CSS and Javascript code as is and use it in your projects.
Or you can download the code as a ZIP file and unzip it. No web server required, you can see it live through your localhost by opening index.html with your browser. Alternatively, you can open your project with VS Code and click on **Go Live** at the bottom right corner, it should open in your default browser.
